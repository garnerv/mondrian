# mondrian
Project for CS313E; Uses the random library, recursion, and turtle graphics to generate mondrian inspired art.

#deeper explanation
Each art piece generated by this program is unique. 
The program works by dividing the available space on the canvas into two pieces until the user typed level of recursion is satisfied. Warning: Levels higher than 6 will take quite a long time to complete.
Random elements of the composition include presence of split line, direction (hortizontal/vertical) of split line, and  colors from a chosen palatte.
